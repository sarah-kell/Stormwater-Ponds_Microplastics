'Fake' Data generated for tidal creek (water and sediment) total microplastic abundances is based upon average concentrations found in the rivers (Ashley, Cooper and Wando) feeding into Charleston Harbor.  Sediment data generated for stormwater ponds is based upon preliminary data (max concentrations) for bottom and edge sediment; water sample data is based upon river data (no prelim data for water in ponds)

Used rnorm to generate data - then manipulated data in Excel to fit expected decrease in microplastic concentrations as you move downstream from the discharge point. 

#Rnorm -Draws random values from a theoretical normal distribution.
#ex: rnorm(n = 10, mean = 100, sd = 5)

SW Ponds 
Bottom Sediment
```{r}
pond.bottom <- rnorm(10, mean = 21700, sd = 200)

```

```{r}
pond.edge <- rnorm(10, mean = 62300, sd = 250)
pond.edge
```

unique(SWponds$site.ID)
SWponds <- data.frame(SWponds[1:150, ]) #removed empty rows 
tail(SWponds)
as.character(levels(SWponds$site.ID))
SWponds$site.ID <- factor(SWponds$site.ID, levels = c("RW Up 50","SW pond","RW Discharge Pt","RW Down 50", "RW Down 100")) #rearranging order of site IDs
```

Analysis- 1-way ANOVA - testing whether there is a difference in microplastic abundances between locations
H0: Total microplastic abundances between locations are equal 

Model 1: SeaSurface Microlayer
 
Result:  There is a significant difference in the mean concentration of MP particles between locations (f= 7.022, p=5.22e-06) 
```{r}
boxplot(total.plastic.liter ~ location, data = SWponds)
Water <- aov(total.plastic.liter ~ location, data = SWponds)
summary(Water)
plot(resid(Water)~fitted(Water))#residuals not normal, variances unequal  
logwater <- aov(log(total.plastic.liter) ~ location, data = SWponds)
summary(logwater)
plot(logwater) #tired to log and log1p transform data - did not improve 
```

Testing for homogeneity of variance across groups using Levene's Test (more robust to departures from normality than Bartlett's)
Null hypo - population variances are equal

Results: Reject null, confirmed variances are unequal (p= 0.004141)
```{r}
leveneTest(total.plastic.liter~location, data=SWponds, center=median)
```

Testing for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test
Result: Confirmed data is not normally distributed  
```{r}
shapiro.test(SWponds$total.plastic.liter)
TPL <- SWponds$total.plastic.liter
histogram(TPL, breaks=10, col="lightblue", xlab= "Total Plastic/Liter")
```

Will use Non-Parametric Test going forward - Kruskal-Wallace

chi-square (H)- rough est. of how different groups are from each other 
larger the H- more different groups are, smaller the H - more similar groups are 
*p-val most important

Results: There is a significant difference in the mean concentration of MP particles in the seasurface microlayer between sampling locations (X2 = 21.55, p=0.01042)

```{r}
water2 <- kruskal.test(total.plastic.liter ~ location, data = SWponds)
water2 
boxplot(total.plastic.liter ~ location, data = SWponds)
```

water3
boxplot(total.plastic.liter ~ site.ID, data = SWponds, ylim = c(0,50), ylab = "Microplastic Particles/liter", xlab = "Location", col = c("lightblue1", "cyan2", "steelblue", "lightblue2","azure"))
#still cutting off RW Down 50 - can't find space 
```

REGRESSION ANALYSIS- Do MP concentrations decrease with increasing distance from SW ponds? 
  Removed the -50 m (upstream from SW ponds) data points since question is looking for 
  relationship between SW ponds and downstream MP concentrations 

```{r}
newSWponds <- filter(SWponds, SWponds$distance.m > -50.00) 
```

SeaSurface Microlayer Results (linear relationship): Significant decrease in MP concentrations as you move downstream from SW ponds (Adj R2 = 0.6255)

```{r}
waterlm <- lm(total.plastic.liter ~ distance.m, data = newSWponds)
summary(waterlm)
coef(waterglm) #summary also shows these numbers 
plot(total.plastic.liter ~ distance.m, data = newSWponds)
abline(c(32.28741, -0.13800)) 
```

```{r}
waterlm <- lm(total.plastic.liter ~ distance.m, data = newSWponds)
summary(waterlm)
co <- coef(waterglm) #summary also shows these numbers 
plot(total.plastic.liter ~ distance.m, data = newSWponds, ylab = "Total Plastic per Liter", xlab = "Distance (m)")
abline(co, col="blue", lwd=1)
```

Checking to see if data fits exponential model better.

plot(log(total.plastic.liter) ~ distance.m, data=newSWponds)
curve()
```

# exponential
f <- function(x,a,b) {a * exp(b * x)}
fit <- nls(y ~ f(x,a,b), start = c(a=1, b=1)) 
co <- coef(fit)
